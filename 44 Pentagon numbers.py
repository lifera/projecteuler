Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3nâˆ’1)/2.
The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8.
However, their difference, 70 âˆ’ 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which
their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk âˆ’ Pj| is minimised;
what is the value of D?
